In this project, a deep analysis of the most recent Airbnb Boston and Seattle dataset is performed to answer the business problems:

* Both Boston and Seattle Airbnb dataset are gathered and cleaned.
* Datasets are analysed through Exploratory and Explanatory analysis.
* A machine learning model is established for predicting the rental price.
* An intuition is developed about the most liked facilities on the basis of reviews by costumers.
